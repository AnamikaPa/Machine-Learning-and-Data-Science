# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science
<ul>
<li>A collection of machine learning and Data Science examples.
<li> Skills: Python, Machine Learning
</ul>

<h2>Problems:</h2>
<ul> 
  <li><b>Kaggle Titanic: </b> Kaggle-Titanic.py
    <ul>
      <li>Predict if a passenger survived the sinking of Titanic or not. 
      <li>For each in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.
      <li>Used K-means Clustering, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest Algorithms.
    </ul>
  <li><b>Song Recommendation System:</b> songs_reccomendation_engine.py</li>
    <ul>
      <li> Popularity based Recommendation System 
      <li> Item Similarity based Recommendation System
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Content based</b> system predicts what a user like based on what that user like in the past.
          <li> <b>Collaborative based</b> system predict what a particular user like based on what other similar users like.
         </ul>    
    </ul>
  <li><b>Breast Cancer:</b> breast_cancer.py</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant.
      <li>Used K-nearest Neighbors algorithm.
    </ul>
  <li><b>Credit Card Fraud Detection:</b> credit_card_fraud_detection.py</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
      <li>This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.
      <li>Used Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm.
    </ul>
  <li><b>Iris:</b> iris.py</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
      <li>One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
      <li>Used Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree, Gaussian naive bayes and Support Vector Classification Algorithms.
    </ul>
  <li><b>Stock Prices Prediction:</b> stock_prices_prediction.py</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Fundamental Analysis involves analyzing the companyâ€™s future profitability on the basis of its current business environment and financial performance.
      <li>Technical Analysis, on the other hand, includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market.
      <li>Used Linear Regression and Support Vector machine Algorithms.
    </ul>
</ul>
